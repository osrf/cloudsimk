			<h4>WHAT IS CLOUDSIM?</h4>
			<p> CloudSim provides robot simulation as a web application. Through the combination of advanced simulation software and cloud computing, CloudSim makes it easy to simulate robots and environments. In addition to simulation management, CloudSim offers the ability to visualize and interact with the simulated 3D worlds right in your browser. Try out CloudSim and discover a low-cost way to use robot simulation technology. </p>

			<h4>HOW DOES CLOUDSIM WORK?</h4>
			<p>CloudSim handles all the work of provisioning cloud-machines and launching simulation. All that you have to do is select what you want to simulate. Once a simulation machine is up and running, you can visualize the 3D world in your browser and programmatically interface to simulation through a secure network connection.</p>

			<h4>WHAT CAN I DO WITH CLOUDSIM?</h4>
			<p> CloudSim gives you a simple interface to cloud-hosted robot simulation software. Through the CloudSim interface, you can control instances of simulation, view all the simulations that you have run in the past, and easily manage payment options. Here, we list just a few uses for CloudSim. </p>
